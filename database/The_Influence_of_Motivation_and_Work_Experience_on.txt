ABSTRACT

This study aims to determine the effect of motivation and work experience on employee performance at
PT. Yamaha Saka Motor in South Tangerang. The method used was explanatory research with a sample
of 43 respondents. The analysis technique uses statistical analysis with regression testing, correlation,
determination, and hypothesis testing. The results of this study motivation significantly influence
employee performance by 47.6%, the hypothesis test obtained significance 0,000 <0.05. Work experience
has a significant effect on employee performance by 36.4%, hypothesis testing obtained significance
0,000 <0.05. Motivation and work experience simultaneously have a significant effect on employee
performance by 57.6%, hypothesis testing obtained significance of 0,000 <0.05.

INTRODUCTION
In a company's operating system, human resource potential is essentially one of the capital
and plays the most important role in achieving company goals (Hasibuan, 2011; Mangkunegara,
2003; Niswaty, AM, Saleh, Baharuddin, & Arhas, 2019; Siagian, 2015). Therefore, companies
need to manage human resources as well as possible. Because the key to the success of a
company is not only on technological excellence and the availability of funds, but the human
factor is also included in it (Edison, Anwar, & Komariyah, 2016; Samsuni, 2017;
Sedarmayanti, 2017).
Through careful human resource planning, the performance of the existing workforce can
be improved (Handoko, 2014; Marwansyah, 2010; Wirawan, 2015; Yani, 2011). This can be
realized through adjustments. Such as increased work experience, experience, and good work
motivation. So that each employee can provide maximum performance for the company or
organization.
Work experience supported by employee motivation can support a company's success in
achieving its goals (Muryani, Paramita, & Fathoni, 2016; Rofi, 2012; Santi, 2013; Supatmi,
Nimran, & Utami, 2018). These factors will provide an impetus for improving performance
which will affect the company's progress. Therefore the development of Human Resources is
increasingly important. This is because the company wants good results and benefits and can
follow the changes and developments that occur in facing tighter competition.

Work experience and motivation are things that play an important role in increasing work
effectiveness (Busro, 2019; Fitriyanto, 2005; Lukito, Haryono, & Warso, 2016; Priansa, 2017)
Because people who have work experience and high work motivation will try their best so that
their work can succeed as well as possible, and will form their own performance and of course
will improve work performance (Moekijat, 2008).
In an effort to improve performance, PT. Yamaha Saka Motor as one of the Yamaha
motorcycle distributors who also provide after-sales service has established several efforts
aimed at providing experience to employees in the service division and other divisions where
such experience will be useful in carrying out their duties and responsibilities. These facilities
include work clothes, food security, recreation, places of worship, holiday allowances, salaries,
bonuses, overtime pay and so on. All this is given by the company so that all employees who
work in it are truly guaranteed and can create a good work experience to achieve a good level of
performance. The level of education and work experience takes precedence. Especially for the
mechanical part (service) Preferred with automotive vocational graduates for basic mechanics
and D3 for Advance mechanics. Work experience is pursued by prioritizing vocational and D3
graduates who are specialized so that the company can provide the best service for loyal
Yamaha motorcycle customers in South Tangerang by providing the best service through
reliable engineering that has experience in the automotive world.

METHOD
The type of research used is associative, where the aim is to find out the relationship
between variables. The population in this study amounted to 43 respondents PT. Yamaha Saka
Motor in South Tangerang The sampling technique in this study is saturated sampling, where all
members of the population are sampled. Thus the sample in this study amounted to 43
respondents. In analyzing the data used the instrument test, classical assumption test, regression,
coefficient of determination and hypothesis testing.

RESULT AND DISCUSSION
PT. Yamaha Saka Motor puts forward the motivation of the company by applying general
rules for all employees and also special rules for mechanics. The regulation is given to be
motivated by paying attention to company standards and company culture developed by the
methods formulated by company management.

Motivation obtained a minimum variance of 33 and a maximum variance of 48 with a
rating score of 3.84 with a standard deviation of 4.392. Work experience obtained a minimum
variance of 31 and a maximum variance of 48 with a rating score of 3.80 with a standard
deviation of 4.129. Employee performance obtained a minimum variance of 32 and a maximum
variance of 47 with a rating score of 3.93 with a standard deviation of 3.796.
Multiple Regression Analysis
This regression test is intended to determine changes in the dependent variable if the
independent variable changes. The test results are as follows:

Based on the test results in the above table, the regression equation Y = 9.469 + 0.461X1 +
0.330X2 is obtained. A constant of 9,469 means that if there is no motivation and work
experience, then there is an employee performance value of 9,469 points. The motivational
regression coefficient of 0.461, this number is positive meaning that every time there is an
increase in motivation of 0.461, the employee's performance will also increase by 0.461 points.
The regression coefficient of work experience of 0.330, this number is positive, meaning that
every time there is an increase in the work experience of 0.330, employee performance will also
increase by 0.330 points.
