1. INTRODUCTION
Indonesia is the one of country that has the fourth number most people in the world
after China, India, and USA. That indicates there is a great potential human resource
development, especially if the quality of human resources’ increased, so it will give a
significant support for the progress Indonesia’s development. Indonesian human
resources is abundant and is the basis of national development in all fields, therefore

the Indonesian government since the new order has pioneered an increase in the
productivity of human resources, namely by increasing the performance of human
resources itself . The launching of the program is based on the idea that productivity
determines the formation of a national growth rate of the index as well as the most
sensitive indicator of economizing process and as a primary gauge of economic
progress of a nation.
Remember that human factor is a prime mover for a total resources to others in
improving productivity, which also become a challenge in Long-term Development
Second Stage (PJPT II) is human resource development that was qualified to have a
high level of performance in every sector development and have the horizon
perspective intellective in that area. The Challenge this requires a change in
management attitude to labor, if all labor are seen as short-term costs (short capitals)
but for now seen as long-term investment whose existence is required for smooth
such organizations. Along with the development of technology and economy, the role
people not only limited as supervisor labor that comes from physical strength, but the
more important is that can use the horizon thinkin to plan and productive activities.
Then in the face globalization era, his splendor effort to improve its human
resources, various cases and issues that indicate symptoms experienced quality. Abuse
of position, a decrease in discipline, and various other irregularities such as the
recruitment of civil servant officer (PNS) which is not an end, the career path of non
- transparent, the proliferation of corruption and collusion, so normatively considered
improper behavior, it sticks through the surface of news from various so that the mass
media consumption .
Many experts are trying to unravel reasons why civil servants have poor
performance. The average of the opinions of experts lead to the theory of Maslow’s
needs , which concludes that a person would do or not do something very dependent
on needs (needs ), if someone felt the need and can fulfill their needs by doing an
activity, it will perform the activity with all the potential it has. However, if an activity
does not significantly affect the life, it tends not to be done. If the theory is applied to
civil servants, less will be able to respond why civil servants have poor performance,
which in turn affects the performance of the government.
Law No. 32 of 2004 on local government article 129, which reads : Paragraph (2)
Civil Service management area as referred to in paragraph (1) shall include the
determination of formation, procurement, appointment, transfer, dismissal, the
determination of retired, salary, benefits, welfare, rights and obligation , legal standing,
competence development, and control number. According to the provisions contained
in Article 129 of Law No. 32 Year 2004 on Regional Government, it showed clearly
and has a strong legal foundation, as guidance in governance and service to society,
that the regional government has the authority to pursue the policy of welfare for
civil servants who were on duty and work in the Local Government’s environment
and exist various forms.

So with the issuance of regulations local government act relating to the formation,
procurement,appointment, transfer, dismissal, the determination of pension, salary,
benefits, welfare, rights and obligations, legal position, the development of
competencies that everything is a form of government support to employees, it should
be government performanceof government able to improve the performance of local
government in all sector, but in fact the performance tends to decline. Based on the
accountability report on the result government performance region government
(LAKIP) government West Java Province in 2013 by referring to high assessment LAKIP
from the Ministry of State Apparatus and Bureaucratic Reform” KementerinAparatur
Negara danReformasiBirokrasi” (PANRB (http://www.menpan.go.id)) shows that
performance accountability of government entered the category less good (D) and is
quite good (C) reached 38.24%, were categorized as good enough (CC) was 38.24%,
while the category as well to satisfy (B, A and AA) only reached 23.53%. In addition,
the low performance achievement institutions in governmentcan be seen also from
the performance achievement of the low institutions based on average assessment
institutions in West Java Province that was under 80.
Mahmood, Iqbal and Samsaa (2014 : 86) in the research said that
“Employee Performance is most important factor in an organization success therefore, there is need
to adopt effective human resources strategies that aim to improve employee performance and creates
the culture of high performance in any organization based on human resource practices”.

That employee performance is most important factors in the successful
organization. Thus, there is a need to adopt a strategy human resources that effective
which aims to improve performance and create the culture high-performance in the
organization resources practices anything based on human beings. Based on that claim,
the low accountability performance of government tends to be caused by the low of
employee performance. The low of employee performanceof government that is
indicated in employee assessmentthat carried out periodically (Per year). Based on
the employee performance data evaluation in each government of government
institution during the time period two consecutive years (2011-2012) with employee
performance evaluation that refer to the government regulation No. 10 The year 1979
employee work achievement assessment of a Civil Servant) that is generally showing
a high performance at the end of 2010 - 2011 rose by 2.41% and 2011- 2012 experienced
a decrease in the amount of 3.90% and at the end of 2012- 2013 experienced a decrease
in the amount of 1% in values with classification is very good, then at the end of 20102011 rose by 3.72%, while at the end of 2011- 2012 was down 5.19 %, and at the end of
2012- 2013, experienced significantly by 9.11% with types of good value. Then the low
performance of civil servants in government also indicated by the low level discipline
time, attendance rate of punctuality and attendance of employees. This is shown based
on observation result directly researchers (2013) showing a high level of employee
delay in some employers’ institutions, which reached 15.55% in 2010 and increased
reached 18.35% in 2011 and absence high enough without explanation (alpha) during
the period of 2010-2013.

710

Mguqulwa (2008:72) put forward based on the result Applicants that the
commitment organizations have been closely intertwined with close ties to employee
performance, the strong commitment of the organization, the employee’s performance
is increasing.Then based on the research results Memari, Mahdieh and Barati (2013:
164) menyatatakan that “the results revealed a positive relationship between organizational
commitment and employees’ job performance”. Based on these results statement, the poor
performance of employees in government tends to be caused by low levels of
organizational commitment. It is indicated based on the observation of the researcher
(2013) on several employees who indicate that the level of pride as a civil servant in
government which only reached by 37.50%, the level of emotional attachment to the
organization 35.00%, the level of dedication to work employees in the organization
30%, and the level of confidence in the identity of employees 27.50%.
Meanwhile Manetje and Martin (2009:87) proposed a finding from his research
that a good organizational culture can enhance the organizational commitment strong
so as to improve organizational performance. Regarding on the statement above, the
low employee performance of civil servants in government still tend to be caused also
by the lack of organizational culture in the of government. Lack of organizational
culture in government institutions shown by direct observation (2013) is characterized
by a lack of passion and spirit of employees in completing work tasks, delay work
habits, work time used to talk about things that have nothing to do with work , low
employee initiatives in the works that seem to always wait for instructions from
superiors, employee invention egoism in doing the job, the employee is less
commendable behavior to be an employee, a lack of understanding of the values of
the organization and the majority of employees only “status” as employees not as a
government employee’s job responsibilities in serving the community.
According to Imran Rabia et. all. (2012:1455) based on the result of research that
“The results reveal positive and significant impact of transformational leadership and organizational
climate on employee performance”. That shows a positive and significant transformational and
climate organization to performance”.

Based on that statement, the low performance of civil servants in
governmentinstitutions tend to be caused by a lack of organizational climate. This is
indicated by not conducive workplaces such as lack of mutual trust among employees
, policies and regulations have not been able to be implemented consistently in dealing
with employee issues that arise jealousy horizontal aperture level civil servants,
promotion are not implemented normative, as well as with the emergence of some
vertical conflict between employees with structural officials in government and
horizontal conflicts among employees, to strike the employees become a solution to
distribute their aspirations.
Paracha Umer et. all. (2012:1) based on the research states
“that transactional and transformational both are significantly positive associated with Employee
performance however transactional leadership was more significant then transformational”.

711

ParachaUmer et all. research results showed that both transactional and
transformational significantly positively related to employee performance but
significant transactional leadership is more than transformational. Based on the
research results statement impositions Rabia Imran et. all. (2012; 1455) and
ParachaUmer et. all. (2012: 1), the low performance of civil servants in government
institutions tend to be caused by the relatively low level of leadership style in
governmentgovernment, this is indicated by the number of employees are less
understanding of the tasks given leadership, lack of providing guidance, lack of
encouragement and motivation to all members / employees in achieving goals,
leadership more priority to formal relationships without regard to the informal aspects,
so the communication relations seem stiff, lack of attention from leader to employees
who become subordinates, lack of confidence from leader to its employees, decisionmaking is always dominated by the understanding unilaterally from the head without
going through the process of coordination previously, do not make subordinates as
partners in achieving the organization’s objectives.
The purpose of this study in this research is to identify and analyze the influence
of organizational culture, organizational climate, and leadership style on organizational
commitment also it’s implication on employee performance of civil servants (PNS) in
government.
2. LITERATURE REVIEW
Organizational Culture
Arnold (2005:625) states that
“that organizational culture is the distinctive norms, beliefs, principles and ways of behaving that
combine to give each organization its distinct character”.

That organizational culture is a typical norms, beliefs, principles and ways of behaving
that combine to give each character a different organization. Harrison (2003: 11) states
that organizational culture is “distinctive constellation of beliefs, values, work styles, and
relationships that distinguish one organization from another”. That organizational culture
is a typical constellation of beliefs, values, work styles, and relationships that distinguish
one from another organization. In other words, cultural organizations including the
nature of the organization that provides a particular climate. Hellriegel et al. (2004:365)
states that elements of culture and their relationships in an organization creates a
unique pattern that is part of the organization, creating a culture of the organization.
Some elements of organizational culture according Hellriegel et al.. consists of a
bureaucratic culture, the local culture (clan culture) and adhocracy culture.
Bureaucratic culture is a kind of organizational culture that respects the rules,
hierarchical coordination, formalization and standard operating procedures, with
long-term problems into efficiency, predictability and stability. Local culture (clan
culture) is the attribute of the type of organization is tradition, loyalty, teamwork,

712

personal commitment and self-management. Organizations focus on their attention
internally, but their formal control flexible. Adhocracy culture is a form of culture that
is characterized by high levels of risk taking, dynamism and creativity.
Organizational Climate
Simamora (2004:81) states that the organizational climate is the internal environment
or organizational psychology. Organizational climate affect human resources practices
and policies adopted by members of the organization. Lussier (2005: 486) says that the
organizational climate on employee perceptions regarding the quality of the
organization’s internal environment is relatively perceived by members of the
organization which in turn affects their behavior. Then Lussier (2005: 487) took a point
that organizational climate include:
1. Structure; the level of perceived coercion of employees because of the rules
and procedures are structured. Organizational objectives, level of
responsibility, the values of the organization.
2. Responsibility; an organization’s level of supervision imposed and perceived
by the employees. Where the quality and form of supervision, direction and
guidance received from superiors to subordinates
3. Support; related to the support for employees in performing organizational
tasks. Matters relating to the support and relationships among co-workers are
feeling is mutual help between management and employees, with more
emphasis on the need of mutual support between superiors and subordinates.
4. Warmth; with regard to the level of employee satisfaction with regard to
relationships within the organization. Feelings toward a friendly working
atmosphere and more emphasis on hospitality or friendship conditions in
informal groups, as well as good relationships between colleagues, the
emphasis on the influence of friendship and informal social groups.
5. Organizational identity and loyalty; a sense of pride associated with the
existence of the organization and the loyalty shown during his tenure. Degree
of loyalty towards the achievement of organizational goals.
6. Risk; related to employees given the space to do or take risks in carrying out
the task as a challenge
Leadership Style
Bass and Avolio (1994) in Munandar (2001) define style of his leadership so far in two
types, namely style transformational and transactional leadership style. Style
Transformational is interaction between the leader and the employees are marked by
the influence of employees become to change on someone with who think that they
are capable and insightful work achievement and trying to reach a high and high

713

quality. Transactional leadership styleis leadership that emphasizes on transaction or
exchanges between leaders, colleagues and his subordinates. This Exchange is based
on a discussion between leader with the related parties to determine what is needed
and how specification conditions and wages/gifts if subordinate conditions for a fixed
term.
Yukl (1989:204) in Ahmad and Gelaidan (2011:3-4) states that
‘Transformational leadership hasbeen defined as “the process of influencingmajor changes in the
attitudes andassumptions of organization members andbuilding commitment for the
organization’smission or objectives.Transactionalleadership is expected to be associated withemployee
commitment to organizationalchange”.

Transformational leadership has been defined as a process that affects a major
change in attitudes and assumptions members of the organization and to build
theorganization’s commitment to achieve the goals of the organization, while the
transactional leadership is expected to be associated with employee commitment to
organizational change.
Organizational Commitment
Gibson et al.. (2012: 182) stated commitment as a sense of identification, loyalty, and
engagement disclosed by an employee of the organization.
This understanding states that the commitment is most hiring on the values of the
organization(identification), engagement(involvement)psychologically and loyalty
(loyalty). This means that employee commitment to the organization has three aspects,
are;
1. identification of which has materialized in the form of trust employees to the
organization;
2. loyalty it show positive attitudes and behavior in the organization, employees
will possess souls who still defended his organization, seeks to improve
achievement, and have confidence that is sure to help realize the goals of the
organization;
3. involvement it will cause a sense of belonging for the employees of the
organization.
Allen and Grisaffe (2001) in Jha (2011:266), organizational commitment describe
the psychological state that characterizes the employee relationship with the
organization for which they work and which has implications for their decision to
remain with the organization . Mayer and Allen (1991) in Jha (201: 266 ) has identified
three types of organizational commitment, namely affective commitment , continuous
commitment and normative commitment .

that the employee’s performance is the result of the quality and quantity of work
achieved by someone employees in carrying out their duties in accordance with the
responsibilitiesgiven to the employee.

3. METHODS
The kind of this research is descriptive and verification, the research method used is
descriptive survey method and explanatory survey. Type of investigation in this study
is causality. The unit of analysis in this study is the staff of government of government
in West Java Province. Time horizon in this study is cross-sectional, for example
information from the majority population (the sample) were collected directly from
the location empirically, with the aim to know the opinion of the majority population
of the object being studied.
Operational definitions of variables are intended to clarify the variables to be
studied, which consists of:
1. Cultural Organization (�1) as independent variables.
2. Organizational Climate (�2) as independent variables.
3. Leadership Style (�3) as independent variables.
4. Organizational Commitment (�1) as variable between.
5. Employee Performance ( �2 ) as the dependent variable .

or report that available in relevant institutions. The primary data in the form of
organizational culture, organizational climate, leadership style, organizational
commitment, and employee performance sourced from staff of government, West Java
Province.
In this study, the object of analysis is the level of SKPD accountability with the
value accountability C and D (more less good and less good), while the population
(the unit of analysis) are civil servants in government which is consists of four groups
(category I , II, III and IV) which amounts are 1685 employees. The sample size was
determined by taking into account the analytical techniques used to test the hypothesis
that structural equation models (structural equation model/SEM). In connection with
the rule of thumb in the SEM, Hair et al.. (2006: 605) states there is no single criterion
for determining the size of the sample (sample size) in SEM, but keep in mind the
ratio of the sample to the parameters (indicators) in order to achieve a ratio of 1: 5.
Based on the rule of thumb in the SEM, so this study used a ratio of 1: 5. This study has
40 parameters (indicators), the minimum sample size is 200 respondents to the selection
of the sample population used proportionate stratified random sampling technique.
The analysis method used in this research is the analysis of SEM (Structural
Equation Modeling) using processing software 8:51 lisrel. In analysis methods of SEM,
statistical estimation individually tested using a t test. Through output path diagram
t-value statistics, t-test results confirm lisrel process complete the test error rate set at
5%. Not only individual test, SEM also test the proposed model as a whole system, for
example through conformance test model as known Goodness of Fit Statistics.

4. RESULT AND DISCUSSION
Based on The table 1 above, there are threeíndexgained fitness model has a suitability
index (goodfit), are: RMSEA, IFI and CFI. While five index compliance model, which
is under the suitability size good, but still within the scope of the marginal (marginal
fit), there are GFI, NNFI, NFI, AGFI and RFI. Marginal fit is the condition of the
suitability of the measurement model under the criterion of absolute fit, as well as
incremental fit, but still can be passed on further analysis, because it is close to the size
criteria for a good fit (Hair, Andersen, Tatham, and Black, 2006:623). Thus it can be
continued in the subsequent analysis.
