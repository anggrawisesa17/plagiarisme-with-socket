Decision Support System (DSS) is a system that can assist a person in making
accurate decisions and targeted. Many problems can be solved by using
CMS, one of which is determining the feasibility of a credit recipient
customers. There are several methods that can be used in building a CMS
one of them is the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). AHP is yan method
most widely used in solving problems that are multiple criteria, such as the
eligibility determination SPK customer credit recipients. This study using
AHP in determining credit worthiness recipient customers on Business
Multipurpose Cooperative Unit of Work Partners XXVIII. In determining the
credit worthiness of customers receiver, there are several criteria on which to
base decisions, among others Dwelling, Income, dependents, and The work.
The end result of this research is the result of global priority customer
criteria, sorted from highest to lowest, so the cooperative can easily make
decisions by looking at the results.

1. Introduction
The system is running in the KSU Cooperative Decision Making Unit of Work Partners XXVIII still
using manual processes and databases that are used in the form of paper, so it takes a long time for
processing. And granting credit lending to customers was given only to capitalize confidence which only
knows the address of the home, business, and ask for the file in the form of photocopy of ID card without
any collateral and survey the location. Other obstacles that are difficult to store and archive search as well
as the risk of data loss is greater. It is influential to customers in a long wait the decision of the company.
2. Theory
2.1 Understanding Decision Support System
Decision support system (DSS) is part of a computer-based information system including a
knowledge-based system or knowledge management is used to support decision making in an
organization or company. Can also be regarded as a computer system that processes data into information
to make a decision on a specific semi-structured problems. SPK can be described as a system that is
capable of supporting ad hoc analysis of data, and decision modeling, decision-oriented and used in times
that are not ordinary.
2.2 Analitychal Hierarchy Process (AHP)
Definition According to Dr. Asthma Th. Ibraheem & Atia Noor S. (2016: 25-26). AHP is a general
theory of measurement. It is used to obtain the relative priority on an absolute scale (invariance under
transformations of identity) of both pairwise comparisons and continuous in multilevel hierarchical
structure. This comparison may be drawn from actual measurements or from a fundamental scale that
reflects the relative strengths of the preferences and feelings.
There are seven procedures in AHP among others, are as follows:

Broadly speaking Openness display interface design decision support using AHP is
a) Main Menu Display
on page The main menu the user is prompted to fill out the criteria and alternatives as well as the
weight has been determined, then processed. And if the user wants to get out of the main page the user
clicks the logout (exit). Here is the main page

cooperative customer due diligence KSU Mitra Karya XXVIII Unit can be concluded as follows:
This application is built to facilitate the decision making due diligence of customers with faster and
better based on the data that has been acquired and processed.
a) With the process of decision support systems in cooperative customer due diligence KSU Mitra Karya
XXVIII Unit can assist companies in selecting the appropriate client be considered.
b) By applying the AHP method kopeasi company KSU Mitra Karya XXVIII can find customers who
deserve to be given credit loans with their customers and their weight values can get assessment
results quickly.
c) Design Decision Support System applications using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 and Microsoft
