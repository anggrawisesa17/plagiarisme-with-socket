ABSTRACT

The relationship between macroeconomic variables and stock market returns
is, by now, well-documented in the literature. However, a void in the literature
relates to examining the cointegration between macroeconomic variables and
stock market’s sector indices rather than the composite index. Thus in this
paper we examine the long-term equilibrium relationships between selected
macroeconomic variables and the Singapore stock market index (STI), as well
as with various Singapore Exchange Sector indices—the ﬁnance index, the
property index, and the hotel index. The study concludes that the Singapore’s
stock market and the property index form cointegrating relationship with
changes in the short and long-term interest rates, industrial production,
price levels, exchange rate and money supply. Implications of the study and
suggestions for future research are provided.
ABSTRAK

Hubungan antara pembolehubah makroekonomi dengan pulangan pasaran
saham, sehingga kini, sudah banyak dihasilkan dalam karya lepas.
Bagaimanapun, masih terdapat kekosongan dalam literatur ini mengenai
hubungan kointegrasi antara pembolehubah ekonomi makro dengan
indeks sektoral dalam pasaran saham berbanding kajian berkatian dengan
indeks komposit. Justeru itu, dalam kertas ini, kami mengkaji hubungan
keseimbangan jangka panjang antara beberapa pembolehubah ekonomi
makro yang terpilih, dengan indeks pasaran saham Singapura (STI) serta
beberapa indeks sektoral – indeks kewangan, indeks hartanah, dan indeks
perhotelan. Kajian ini mendapati bahawa pasaran saham Singapura dan
indeks hartanah menunjukkan hubungan kointegrasi dengan perubahan kadar
bunga jangka pendek dan jangka panjang juga dengan pengeluaran industri,
paras harga, kadar tukaran mata wang dan penawaran wang. Implikasi
kajian dan cadangan kajian untuk masa depan dikemukakan.

INTRODUCTION
An efﬁcient capital market is one in which security prices adjust rapidly to
the arrival of new information and, therefore, the current prices of securities
reﬂect all information about the security. What this means, in simple terms,
is that no investor should be able to employ readily available information
in order to predict stock price movements quickly enough so as to make a
proﬁt through trading shares.
Championed by Fama (1970), the efﬁcient market hypothesis (EMH), in
particular semi-strong form efﬁciency, which states that stock prices must
contain all relevant information including publicly available information,
has important implications for policy-makers and the stock-broking industry
alike.
Policy makers, for example, should feel free to conduct national
macroeconomic policies without the fear of inﬂuencing capital formation
and the stock trade process. Moreover, economic theory suggests that stock
prices should reﬂect expectations about future corporate performance, and
corporate proﬁts generally reﬂect the level of economic activities. If stock
prices accurately reﬂect the underlying fundamentals, then the stock prices
should be employed as leading indicators of future economic activities,
and not the other way around. Therefore, the causal relations and dynamic
interactions among macroeconomic variables and stock prices are important
in the formulation of the nation’s macroeconomic policy.
As for the effect of macroeconomic variables such as money supply and
interest rate on stock prices, the efﬁcient market hypothesis suggests that
competition among the proﬁt-maximizing investors in an efﬁcient market
will ensure that all the relevant information currently known about changes
in macroeconomic variables are fully reﬂected in current stock prices, so
that investors will not be able to earn abnormal proﬁt through prediction of
the future stock market movements (Chong and Koh 2003).
Therefore, since investment advisors would not be able to help investors
earn above-average returns consistently, except through access to and
employing insider information, a practice generally prohibited and punishable
by law, there should be no stock broking industry, if one were to believe
the conclusions of the EMH.
In direct contradiction to the conclusions drawn by the EMH, evidence
that key macroeconomic variables help predict the time series of stock returns
has accumulated for nearly 30 years. The assault on the conclusions drawn
from the EMH includes early studies by Fama and Schwert (1977), Nelson
(1977), and Jaffe and Mandelker (1976), all afﬁrming that macroeconomic
variables inﬂuence stock returns.
Concentrating primarily on the US stock exchanges, such early studies
attempted to capture the effects of economic forces in a theoretical framework

based on the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) developed by Ross (1976). The
APT essentially seeks to measure the risk premia attached to various factors
that inﬂuence the returns on assets, whether they are signiﬁcant, and whether
they are “priced” into stock market returns. Accordingly, Chen, Roll and Ross
(1986), having ﬁrst illustrated that economic forces affect discount rates, the
ability of ﬁrms to generate cash ﬂows, and future dividend payouts, provided
the basis for the belief that a long-term equilibrium existed between stock
prices and macroeconomic variables.
More recently, Granger (1986) and Johansen and Juselius (1990) proposed
to determine the existence of long-term equilibrium among selected variables
through cointegration analysis, paving the way for a (by now) preferred
approach to examining the economic variables-stock markets relationship.
A set of time-series variables are cointegrated if they are integrated of the
same order and a linear combination of them is stationary. Such linear
combinations would then point to the existence of a long-term relationship
between the variables. An advantage of cointegration analysis is that through
building an error-correction model (ECM), the dynamic co-movement among
variables and the adjustment process toward long-term equilibrium can be
examined.
Employing this methodology, there has been a growing literature showing
strong inﬂuence of macroeconomic variables and stock markets, mostly for
industrialized countries (see, for example, Hondroyiannis and Papapetrou,
2001; Muradoglu et al. 2001; Fiﬁeld et al. 2000; Lovatt and Ashok 2000;
and Nasseh and Strauss 2000). Additionally, researchers have begun to turn
their attention to examining similar relationships in developing countries,
particularly those in the growth engines of Asia (for example, Maysami and
Sims 2002, Maysami and Koh 2000).
The majority, if not all, of such studies have examined the inﬂuence of
the macroeconomic variables on the composite stock indices of the markets
under study. A void in the literature, thus, relates to examining the cointegration
between macroeconomic variables and stock market’s sector indices rather
than the composite index. This paper aims to complement the literature in
this area.
Applying Johansen’s (1990) VECM, the study examines the long-term
equilibrium relationships between selected macroeconomic variables and (1)
the Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) All-S Equities Finance Index, (2)
the SES All-S Equities Property Index, and (3) the SES All-S Equities Hotel
Index. Additionally, the study extends Maysami and Koh’s (2000) enquiry
of the cointegrating relationship between macroeconomic variables and the
SES All-S Equities Index, by incorporating the effects of market volatility
during the seven-year period between February 1995 and December 2001.
The paper begins with a thorough introduction to the literature and
establishes the theoretical and empirical justiﬁcation for modeling the stock

50

market and sector indices using macroeconomic variables. The Johansen’s
(1990) vector error correction model (VECM) and its estimation procedures
are discussed next, along with an explanation of macroeconomic variables
employed in the study. The last section will report and discusses the
results.
LITERATURE REVIEW
Emerging stock markets have been identiﬁed as being at least partially
segmented from global capital markets. As a consequence, it has been argued
that local risk factors rather than world risk factors are the primary source
of equity return variation in these markets. Accordingly, Bilson, Brailsford,
and Hooper (1999) aimed to address the question of whether macroeconomic
variables may proxy for local risk sources. They found moderate evidence
to support this hypothesis.
Further, they investigated the degree of commonality in exposures across
emerging stock market returns using a principal components approach, and
found little evidence of commonality when emerging markets are considered
collectively. At the regional level, however, considerable commonality was
shown to exist.
Maysami and Sims (2002, 2001a, 2001b) employed the Error-Correction
Modelling technique to examine the relationship between macroeconomic
variables and stock returns in Hong Kong and Singapore (Maysami and Sim,
2002b), Malaysia and Thailand (Maysami and Sim 2001a), and Japan and
Korea (Maysami and Sim 2001b).
Through the employment of Hendry’s (1986) approach which allows
making inferences to the short-run relationship between macroeconomic
variables as well as the long-run adjustment to equilibrium, they analysed
the inﬂuence of interest rate, inﬂation, money supply, exchange rate and real
activity, along with a dummy variable to capture the impact of the 1997
Asian ﬁnancial crisis. The results conﬁrmed the inﬂuence of macroeconomic
variables on the stock market indices in each of the six countries under study,
though the type and magnitude of the associations differed depending on the
country’s ﬁnancial structure.
Islam (2003) replicated the above studies to examine the short-run
dynamic adjustment and the long-run equilibrium relationships between four
macroeconomic variables (interest rate, inﬂation rate, exchange rate, and
the industrial productivity) and the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE)
Composite Index. His conclusions were similar: there existed statistically
signiﬁcant short-run (dynamic) and long-run (equilibrium) relationships among
the macroeconomic variables and the KLSE stock returns.
Ibrahim (1999) also investigated the dynamic interactions between
the KLSE Composite Index, and seven macroeconomic variables (industrial
production index, money supply M1 and M2, consumer price index, foreign

Relationship between Macroeconomic Variables and Stock Market Indices

51

reserves, credit aggregates and exchange rate). Observing that macroeconomic
variables led the Malaysian stock indices, he concluded that Malaysian stock
market was informationally inefﬁcient.
Chong and Koh’s (2003) results were similar: they showed that stock
prices, economic activities, real interest rates and real money balances in
Malaysia were linked in the long run both in the pre- and post capital control
sub periods.
Mukherjee and Naka (1995) applied Johansen’s (1998) VECM to analyze
the relationship between the Japanese Stock Market and exchange rate,
inﬂation, money supply, real economic activity, long-term government bond
rate, and call money rate. They concluded that a cointegrating relation indeed
existed and that stock prices contributed to this relation. Maysami and Koh
(2000) examined such relationships in Singapore. They found that inﬂation,
money supply growth, changes in short- and long-term interest rate and
variations in exchange rate formed a cointegrating relation with changes in
Singapore’s stock market levels.
Islam and Watanapalachaikul (2003) showed a strong, signiﬁcant long-run
relationship between stock prices and macroeconomic factors (interest rate,
bonds price, foreign exchange rate, price-earning ratio, market capitalization,
and consumer price index) during 1992-2001 in Thailand.
Hassan (2003) employed Johansen’s (1988, 1991, 1992b) and Johansen
and Juselius’ (1990) multivariate cointegration techniques to test for the
existence of long-term relationships between share prices in the Persian
Gulf region. Using a vector-error-correction model, he also investigated the
short-term dynamics of prices by testing for the existence and direction of
intertemporal Granger-causality.
The analysis of weekly price indices in Kuwait, Bahrain, and Oman
stock markets showed that: (1) share prices were cointegrated with one
cointegrating vector and two common stochastic trends driving the series,
which indicates the existence of a stable, long-term equilibrium relationship
between them; and (2) prices were not affected by short-term changes but
were moving along the trend values of each other. Therefore, information
on the price levels would be helpful for predicting their changes.
Omran (2003) focused on examining the impact of real interest rates as
a key factor in the performance of the Egyptian stock market, both in terms
of market activity and liquidity. The cointegration analysis through error
correction mechanisms (ECM) indicated signiﬁcant long-run and short-run
relationships between the variables, implying that real interest rates had an
impact upon stock market performance.
Vuyyuri (2005) investigated the cointegrating relationship and the
causality between the ﬁnancial and the real sectors of the Indian economy
using monthly observations from 1992 through December 2002. The ﬁnancial
variables used were interest rates, inﬂation rate, exchange rate, stock return,

52

and real sector was proxied by industrial productivity. Johansen (1988)
multivariate cointegration test supported the long-run equilibrium relationship
between the ﬁnancial sector and the real sector, and the Granger test showed
unidirectional Granger causality between the ﬁnancial sector and real sector
of the economy.
Maghyereh (2002) investigated the long-run relationship between the
Jordanian stock prices and selected macroeconomic variables, again by using
Johansen’s (1988) cointegration analysis and monthly time series data for
the period from January 1987 to December 2000. The study showed that
macroeconomic variables were reﬂected in stock prices in the Jordanian
capital market.
Gunasekarage, Pisedtasalasai and Power (2004) examined the inﬂuence of
macroeconomic variables on stock market equity values in Sri Lanka, using
the Colombo All Share price index to represent the stock market and (1) the
money supply, (2) the treasury bill rate (as a measure of interest rates), (3)
the consumer price index (as a measure of inﬂation), and (4) the exchange
rate as macroeconomic variables.
With monthly data for the 17-year period from January 1985 to
December 2001 and employing the usual battery of tests, which included unit
roots, cointegration, and VECM, they examined both long-run and short-run
relationships between the stock market index and the economic variables.
The VECM analysis provided support for the argument that the lagged values
of macroeconomic variables such as the consumer price index, the money
supply and the Treasury bill rate have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the stock
market.
The literature examining the relation of macroeconomic variables on
individual stock market indices is scarce. Maysami et al. (2005), as intermittent
illustration, assessed the existence of long-run cointegrating relationship among
stocks listed dually in the US and Singapore stock markets. In addition, they
used Johansen’s (1988) VECM, to examine the co-movement between sectoral
stock indices of the U.S. and Singapore, through examining whether the
S&P 500 Electronics (Semiconductor) Price Index leads Stock Exchange of
Singapore’s Electronics Price Index. While their results conﬁrmed the longterm cointegrating sectoral relationships, there was evidence pointing to a
short-term disequilibria in the prices of dually listed stocks, leading to the
conclusion that short-run arbitrage opportunities may exist.
Ta and Teo (1985) had earlier observed high correlation among six
Singapore sector indices in the period 1975 to 1984 and the overall SES
market return (e.g. All-S Equities Industrial and Commercial Index, SES All-S
Equities Finance Index, SES All-S Equities Property Index, SES All-S Hotel
Index, SES All-S Plantation Index and SES All-S Mining Index). Using daily
data in examining the relationships, they had concluded that sector returns
were highly correlated to each other, although such correlations did not remain

53

stable over time. Sun and Brannman (1994) similarly found a single long-run
relationship among the SES All-S Equities Industrial & Commercial Index,
Finance Index, Hotel Index, and Property Index from 1975 to 1992.
The current study builds upon and extends the literature through the
employment of Johansen’s (1988) VECM to examine the long-run equilibrium
relationship between selected macroeconomic variables and stock market sector
indices represented on the Stock Exchange of Singapore (recently demutualized
and renamed the Singapore Exchange (SGX)): the Finance Index, the Property
Index, and the Hotel Index. The choice of macroeconomic variables and the
hypothesized relations with the sector indices are discussed next.
HYPOTHESES
Based on intuitive ﬁnancial theory (Chen et al. 1986; Fama 1981) coupled with
the results of previous studies, this article hypothesizes certain relationships
between short and long-term interest rates, industrial production, price levels,
exchange rate and money supply with the SES All-S Equities Finance, Property
and Hotel Sector Indices.
INTEREST RATE

The simple dividend-discount valuation model may be used to explain the
impact of economic factors on stock returns. Assuming constant growth in
dividends,
P=D1/(k-g)

(1)

where P= stock price, D1= dividends after ﬁrst period, g= constant growth
rate of the dividends and k= required rate of return on the stock.
Mukherjee and Naka (1995) hypothesized that changes in both short- and
long-term government bond rates would affect the nominal risk-free rate and
thus affect the discount rate. Fama and Schwert (1977) observed that the
relationship applied to both the current period as well as for lagged values of
the interest rates. Reily and Brown (2000), however, complicated the matter
a bit by stating that cash ﬂows from stocks can change along with interest
rates and it is not certain whether this change in cash ﬂows will augment
or offset the change in interest rates.
We hypothesize a negative relationship between interest rates and stock
prices for the following reasons: (1) interest rates can inﬂuence the level of
corporate proﬁts which in turn inﬂuence the price that investors are willing
to pay for the stock through expectations of higher future dividends payment.
Most companies ﬁnance their capital equipments and inventories through
borrowings. A reduction in interest rates reduces the costs of borrowing and

54

Jurnal Pengurusan 24

thus serves as an incentive for expansion. This will have a positive effect
on future expected returns for the ﬁrm; (2) as substantial amount of stocks
are purchased with borrowed money, hence an increase in interest rates
would make stock transactions more costly. Investors will require a higher
rate of return before investing. This will reduce demand and lead to a price
depreciation.
INFLATION

The results of studies by Fama and Schwert (1977), Chen, Roll and Ross
(1986), Nelson (1976) and Jaffe and Mandelker (1976) pointed to a negative
relation between inﬂation and stock prices. We hypothesize similarly: an
increase in the rate of inﬂation is likely to lead to economic tightening
policies, which in turn increases the nominal risk-free rate and hence raises
the discount rate in the valuation model (equation 1).
The effect of a higher discount rate would not necessarily be neutralized
by an increase in cash ﬂows resulting from inﬂation, primarily because cash
ﬂows do not generally grow at the same rate as inﬂation. DeFina (1991)
attributes this to nominal contracts that disallow the immediate adjustment of
the ﬁrm’s revenues and costs. Cash ﬂows would probably decrease initially
if the cost of inputs adjusts faster to rising inﬂation than output prices.
EXCHANGE RATES

We hypothesize a positive relation between the exchange rate and stock
prices. A depreciation of the Singapore dollar will lead to an increase
in demand for Singapore’s exports and thereby increasing cash ﬂows to
the country, assuming that the demand for exports is sufﬁciently elastic.
Alternatively, if the Singapore dollar is expected to appreciate, the market
will attract investments. This rise in demand will push up the stock market
level, suggesting that stock market returns will be positively correlated to
the changes in the exchange rates (Mukherjee and Naka 1995).
The impact of exchange rate changes on the economy will depend to a
large extent on the level of international trade and the trade balance. Hence
the impact will be determined by the relative dominance of import and export
sectors of the economy.
INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION

Tainer (1993) is of the view that the industrial production index is
procyclical – that is, it rises during economic expansion and falls during
a recession. It is typically used as a proxy for the level of real economic
activity, that is, a rise in industrial production would signal economic growth.
Fama (1990) and Geske and Roll, (1983) hypothesized a similar positive
relationship through the effects of industrial production on expected future
cash ﬂows.

Relationship between Macroeconomic Variables and Stock Market Indices

55

The productive capacity of an economy indeed depends directly on the
accumulation of real assets, which in turn contributes to the ability of ﬁrms
to generate cash ﬂow. Chen, Roll and Ross’ (1986) ﬁndings based on a US
stock portfolio, indicated that future growth in industrial production was a
signiﬁcant factor in explaining stock returns. Hence, suggesting a positive
relationship between real economic activities and stock prices. We hypothesize
similarly. Fama (1981) had earlier found that the growth rate of industrial
production had a strong contemporaneous relation with stock returns.
MONEY SUPPLY

Friedman and Schwartz (1963) explained the relationship between money
supply and stock returns by simply hypothesizing that the growth rate of
money supply would affect the aggregate economy and hence the expected
stock returns.
An increase in M2 growth would indicate excess liquidity available for
buying securities, resulting in higher security prices. Empirically, Hamburger
and Kochin (1972) and Kraft and Kraft (1977) found a strong linkage between
the two variables, while Cooper (1974) and Nozar and Taylor (1988) found
no relation.
In the opinion of Mukherjee and Naka (1995), the effect of money supply
on stock prices is an empirical question. An increase in money supply would
lead to inﬂation, and may increase discount rate and reduce stock prices
(Fama, 1981). The negative effects might be countered by the economic
stimulus provided by money growth, also known as the corporate earnings
effect, which may increase future cash ﬂows and stock prices. Maysami
and Koh (2000), who found a positive relationship between money supply
changes and stock returns in Singapore, further support this hypothesis.
THE STOCK EXCHANGE OF SINGAPORE
The Singapore Exchange Ltd (SGX) was formed on December 1, 1999 through
the merger of the Stock Exchange of Singapore Ltd (SES) and the Singapore
International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX), thus establishing Asia Paciﬁc’s ﬁrst
demutualized, integrated securities and derivatives exchange. The origins of
the Stock Exchange may be traced back to 1930 with the formation of the
Singapore Stockbrokers’ Association to regulate trading activities in serving
the public’s interest. A joint exchange under the name of Stock Exchange of
Malaysia was subsequently formed between Singapore and Malaysia.
The Stock Exchange of Singapore Ltd (SES) was incorporated on May
24, 1973, following an ofﬁcial split from the Stock Exchange of Malaysia.
On October 1980, SES was admitted into the International Foundation of

56

Jurnal Pengurusan 24

Stock Exchanges, marking its advancement in the global arena. In 1986,
the failure of private and institutional investors to meet their obligations
on forward contracts on Pan Electric shares resulted in a three-day closure
of the market. This led to the amendment of the Securities Industry Act of
1986 to include tighter provisions governing securities operations.
The ﬁrst test facing the revised Act was on Oct 20, 1987, whereby the
Straits Times Industrial Index (STI) plunged 261.78 points following the Wall
Street’s crash on Black Monday. This date marked the biggest one-day drop
in the history of the SES. Despite the substantial decline in the market, none
of the SES member ﬁrms experienced ﬁnancial difﬁculty.
In the early phase of incorporation, listed stocks on the SES Main board
were classiﬁed into seven industry sections, namely, Industrial and Commercial,
Finance, Hotel, Property, Plantation, Mining and Debentures Bonds and Loan
Stocks. The guiding criteria in the selection of the stocks included in each
of these indices were the liquidity of the shares, the company’s size and its
proﬁtability. The rapid industrialization and transformation of the Singapore
economy saw these sectors being replaced or at least complemented by new
industrial pillars. An example is the introduction of the SES All-S Equities
Electronics in 1996. On 31 August 1998, SES introduced its new 8-sector
classiﬁcation of listed companies. The eight industrial sectors are Multiindustry, Manufacturing, Construction, Commerce, Finance, Hotel/Restaurant,
Property, and Transport/Storage/Communication. Table 1 depicts the most
recent ﬁnancial conditions of the SGX.
THE SES ALL-S EQUITIES FINANCE INDEX

Starting September 1994, the Singapore government has embarked on
an ambitious plan to develop Singapore into a regional and international
portfolio/fund management center. The SES All-S Equities Finance Index
tracks the share price performance of all listed ﬁnancial institutions on the
SGX Main board. Speciﬁcally, it is a composite of banks, ﬁnance companies,
investment companies and unit trusts, stockbrokers, insurance and other
ﬁnancial services.
The Finance Index is one of the sector leaders on the SGX, taking up
31.7% ordinary shares of total market capitalization as at November 2001.
Total turnover amounted to $34.09 billion or 32.43% of overall turnover of
$105.10 billion. A series of recent liberalization measures is likely to result
in new market entries by large ﬁnancial entities, thus leading to a further
potential increase in total market capitalization.
THE SES ALL-S EQUITIES PROPERTY INDEX
The SES All-S Equities Property Index tracks the share price performance
of all listed property companies on the SGX Main board, including stocks

of companies with residential exposure. The listed companies represent a
combination of both investment and development ﬁrms. Investment in listed
Singapore property stocks reported a market capitalization of approximately
S$17.13 million or about 8.9% of the total market value and a market turnover
of $6.77 billion in November 2001.
Despite the consensus that the property market in Singapore has/will
developed in tandem with the economy, unique demand and supply factors
(e.g. long gestation period of the construction process, information inefﬁciency
and the inherent physical structure of property assets) has led to higher
volatility for property-related stocks (Wang and Liow 2000).
THE SES ALL-S EQUITIES HOTEL INDEX

The SES All-S Equities Hotel Index tracks the share price performance of
the 17 listed Hotels on the SGX Main board. At the end of November 2001,
the market capitalization of Singapore listed hotels stood at $5.08 billion or
2.64% of the total market capitalization of companies listed. Total turnover
generated by the hotel sector amounted to $0.33 billion out of the overall
turnover of $105.1 billion. The hotel industry is closely tied to the tourism
sector, which has assumed an increasingly important role in Singapore’s
economic growth. This is reﬂected by the Republic’s attempt to strengthen
its status as a major convention and exhibition center in the Asia Paciﬁc
region as well as enhancing its standing as a shoppers’ paradise.
METHODOLOGY AND DATA
This section provides an overview of the model employed, the econometric
tests performed, the source of and the type of data used.
THE MODEL

Examination of the dynamic relations between macroeconomic variables
and the various sector indices may be undertaken through either Engle and
Granger (1987) or Johansen and Juselius (1990) protocols. While Engle and
Granger’s (1987) two-step error correction model may be used in a multivariate
context, the Johansen’s (1990) VECM yields more efﬁcient estimators of
cointegrating vectors. This is because the Johansen’s (1990) VECM is a full
information maximum likelihood estimation model, which allows for testing
cointegration in a whole system of equations in one step, without requiring a
speciﬁc variable to be normalized. This allows researchers to avoid carrying
over the errors from the ﬁrst- into the second step, unlike the case of Engle
and Granger’s (1987) methodology. It also allows the avoidance of a priori
of assumptions of endogenity or exogeniety of variables. The VECM is of
the form:

Relationship between Macroeconomic Variables and Stock Market Indices

∆zt = Γ1∑ ∆zt-1 + ... + Γk-1 ∆zt-k+1 + Πzt-k + μt

59

(2)

Where ∆ denotes ﬁrst differences, Γi = -(I-A1-…-Ai), (I = 1, … , k-1), and
Π= -(I-A1- … -Ak). The short and long-run adjustments to z is speciﬁed by
the estimates of Γi and Π. Π= αβʹ where α is the speed of adjustment to
disequilibrium and β is the matrix of long-run coefﬁcients that represents
up to n-1 cointegration relationship and ensures that zts converge to their
long-run steady state.
ESTIMATION

Estimating the

VECM

proceeds in the following manner:

1. Pre-test for stationary and lag-length:
This is to ensure that the variables are stationary and that shocks are
only temporary and will dissipate and revert to their long-run mean. The
tests for stationarity or unit roots employ the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF)
and Phillips-Peron (PP) test performed on the variables in levels and ﬁrst
differences. Cointegration requires that all the variables be integrated of the
same order. To test for unit roots, we will use the ADF which tests the null
hypothesis of
H 0 : γ = 0 in
∆yt = a0 + γyt-1

+

p

∑ βi ∆yt-i+1

+ εt

(3)

to examine whether a unit root exists. The ADF test assumes the asymptotic
normality of the idiosyncratic error term, εt, in (3).
The choice of lag-lengths may be decided using Sims likelihood ratio
test. The appropriate lag length is important as too many lags reduce the
power of the test due to the estimation of additional parameters and a
loss of degrees of freedom. In contrast, too few lags may not capture the
dynamics of the actual error correction process, resulting in poor estimates
of g and its standard errors. This paper employs the multivariate forms of
the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Schwartz Bayesian criterion
(SBC) to determine lag lengths. Both are model selection criteria developed
for maximum likelihood estimation techniques, where:
AIC
SBC

= T ln (residual sumi=2of squares) + 2n
and
= T ln (residual sum of squares) + n ln (T)

In minimising the AIC and SBC, we minimise the natural logarithm of
the residual sum of squares adjusted for sample size, n, and the number of
parameters included, T.

2. Estimate the model by regressing the ∆z matrix against the lagged
differences of ∆zt-i and determine the rank of p = ab¢. The eigenvectors
in b¢ are estimated from the canonical correlations of the set of residuals
from the regression equations. To determine the rank of p, which will give
the order of cointegration, r, the characteristic roots or eigenvalues of p, li
should be estimated.
We do this by testing the null hypothesis that there are at most r
cointegration vectors and thus (n-r) unit roots, i.e. H0: λi= 0 where i=
r+1,..…
The λ test statistics is
λtrace = -T

r=0, 1, 2, …, n-2, n-1

(4)

The choice of the number of maximum cointegrating relationships will
be based on the λtrace test to examine the speciﬁc hypotheses. We will reject
models where π has full rank as in such a situation, zt is stationary and has
no unit root and so there is no error correction.
3. Having determined the order of cointegration, we will select and analyse
the relevant cointegrating vector and speed of adjustment coefﬁcients.
Assuming π does not have full rank and there are multiple cointegrating
vectors, we will choose the ﬁrst eigenvector based on the largest eigenvalue,
which is regarded as the most useful. Since we consider the natural logarithm
of the SES All-S Equities Price Index, SES All-S Equities Finance Index, SES
All-S Equities Property Index and SES All-S Equities Hotel Index to be the
dependent variable, we will normalise β’ with respect to the coefﬁcients for
i=r+1
these indices.

for the variables to be of the same order of integration. Although different
forms of the Johansen tests have been used to detect differing orders of
integration, it is best not to mix variables with differing orders of integration
as recommended by the Johansen’s (1990) methodology.
For the testing of unit roots, the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) or PhillipsPerron (PP) Tests may be used. The result of the ADF to determine the
presence of unit roots is reported in Table 5. Since the results of the unit
root test can be sensitive to the lag length selected, we will select the lag
length p using the multivariate generalizations of the Akaike Information
Criteria (AIC). The lag length chosen for each variables based on the lowest
AIC is also reported in Table 4.
All the variables reported are stationary at 1% signiﬁcance level based on

DETERMINATION OF RANK

The next step involves estimating the model and determining the rank of p.
By testing for cointegration rank we will be able to determine the number
of cointegrating relations in our model. The model based on the lowest AIC
was the one with the truncated lag length of p=5 for SES All-S Equities
Index, p=2 for SES All-S Equities Finance Index, p=5 for SES All-S Equities
Property Index and p=5 for SES All-S Equities Hotel Index. We report ltrace
and lmax values and their critical values at both 1% and 5% in Table 5.
When the results obtained from the λtrace and λmax tests yield different
conclusions, the λtrace statistic is preferred. This is supported by Cheung
and Lai (1993) who found that the λtrace test shows more robustness to both
skewness and excess kurtosis in the residuals than that of the λmax test. The
results for the λtrace test with the selected lag lengths indicate that there is
no more than one cointegrating relationship at either the 1% and 5% level
for all the models speciﬁed. We thus conclude that there is one cointegrating
vector (i.e. r = 1).
COINTEGRATION RESULTS

The normalized cointegrating coefﬁcients for the SES All-S Equities Index
(LSESt) are
Yt = (LSESt LCPIt LIPt LSDRt LSTBt LM2t LLTBt)
β1’ = (1.00, -11.66, -4.20, 5.91, -2.51, -4.34, 4.41)
These values represent long-term elasticity measures, due to logarithmic
transformation of SES (normalized), CPI, IP, SDR, STB, LM2 and LTB. Thus,
the cointegration relationship can be re-expressed as:
LSESt

ANALYSIS OF RESULTS
SES ALL-S EQUITIES INDEX

The coefﬁcients for LCPIt, LIPt, LSTBt, and LM2t are positive, while the signs
between LSDRt, LLTBt and LSESt are both negative. The intercept term is
positive.
Fama and Schwert (1977), Geske and Roll (1983), Chen, Roll and Ross

68

Jurnal Pengurusan 24

(1986) and Mukherjee and Naka (1995) have suggested a negative relation
between stock returns and inﬂation. These ﬁnding are contrary to the results
of our study which documents a signiﬁcant positive relationship between
inﬂation and Singapore stock returns.
A possible explanation for the positive relationship might be the
government’s active role in preventing prices escalation as the economy
continued to improve after the 1997 crisis. Firth (1979) posited that holding
stocks might be an effective hedge against inﬂation and hence the “Fisher
effect” would explain this positive correlation. Marshall (1992) stated that
if inﬂation is caused by money shock, it would lower the rate of interest
and investors would shift their cash holdings to stocks and bonds in order
to maximize potential capital gains. The increase in demand would in turn
raise stock prices. Increases in expected inﬂation may also signal a potential
increase in real activity, production and hence higher stock returns (Fama
and Gibbons, 1982).
There is evidence that stock returns are positively and signiﬁcantly
related to the level of real economic activity as proxied by the industrial
production index. Fama (1981) explained this by suggesting that the market
makes rational forecasts of the real sector, while Chen, Roll and Ross (1986)
argued that the positive relation reﬂects the value of insuring against real
systematic production risks. Changes in productive activity, through their
impact on expected dividends, should in turn inﬂuence stock returns (Maysami
and Koh 2000).
Short- and long-term interest rates have signiﬁcant respectively positive
and negative relations with the Singapore’s stock market based on the results
of the current study. This is consistent with the ﬁndings of Bulmash and
Trivoli (1991) in the case of the United States, and by Mukherjee and Naka
(1995) for Japan. Maysami and Koh (2000) similarly observed a positive
relationship between the Singapore stock market and short-term interest rates
while the long-term rate was negative. The reason is probably that long-term
interest rate serve as a better proxy for the nominal risk-free component used
in the discount rate in the stock valuation models and may also serve as a
surrogate for expected inﬂation in the discount rate.
The positive correlation between money supply changes and stock
returns is consistent with the ﬁndings of Mukherjee and Naka (1995) who
attributed a rise in the discount rate to the expansionary effect of money
supply increase. Fama (1981) explained a spurious, rather than causal, positive
relation between money supply and stock prices through a simple quantity
theory model, where money demand is stimulated through increases in real
activity, which in turn drive stock returns.
The results of our study support the hypothesis of a positive relationship
between exchange rate and the Singapore stock market. This is similar to
the ﬁndings of Maysami and Koh (2000). They explained that with the high

Relationship between Macroeconomic Variables and Stock Market Indices

69

import and export content in the Singapore’s economy, a stronger domestic
currency lowers the cost of imported inputs and allows local producers to
be more competitive internationally. Yip (1996) also explained that a strong
Singapore dollar limits imported inﬂation and hence is perceived as favourable
news by the Singapore stock market, thereby generating positive returns.
SES ALL-S EQUITIES FINANCE INDEX

The coefﬁcients for LCPIt, LSTBt, and LM2t are positive, while those between LIPt,
LSDRt,, LLTBt, and LFNCEt are negative. The intercept term is also positive.
The relationships between the ﬁnance index and the macroeconomic variables
are similar for the Singapore stock market except in the case of the real
economic activity, which depicts an insigniﬁcant relationship. One possible
explanation for this maybe the fact that the accumulation of real assets,
which contributes to the economy’s productive capacity, and investments in
the ﬁnance sector are viewed as alternative investments.
The ﬁnance sector is signiﬁcantly affected by changes in inﬂation rates,
exchange rates, and both short- and long- term interest rates. The impact of
changes in money supply to the ﬁnance sector is weaker as compared to the
Singapore’s stock market.
SES ALL-S EQUITIES PROPERTY INDEX

The coefﬁcients for LCPIt, LIPt, LSTBt, and LM2t are positive, while those
of LSDRt and LLTBt, are negative. The intercept term is also positive. All
relations between the property sector and the macroeconomic variables are
Signiﬁcant.
The signs of the coefﬁcients are similar to those of the Singapore stock
market. This is supported by the ﬁndings of Wang and Liow (1999) who
reported a strong co-movement in the returns of property stocks and the
general market. Although the property sector reacts in tandem with the stock
market to changes in the macroeconomic variables, the impact is relatively
higher. For instance, a 1% increase in real activity would result in a 7.83%
rise in the property index, while the stock market return would increase by
4.2%. The higher volatility in the property sector relative to the overall
market, also coincides with Wang and Liow’s (2000) ﬁndings.
SES ALL-S EQUITIES HOTEL INDEX

The coefﬁcients for LIPt, LSDRt and LLTBt are positive, while those for LCPIt,
LSTBt and LM2t are negative. The intercept term is positive. Curiously, the
signs for all coefﬁcients are opposite of those observed for the Singapore
stock market, except for real economic activity.
Based on our results, short- and long-term interest rates as well as the
money supply do not have signiﬁcant effects on the Singapore Hotel Index.

70

Jurnal Pengurusan 24

The signiﬁcant negative relation between the Hotel sector returns and the
exchange rate is the result of the fact that depreciation is deemed favourable
for the Singapore tourism industry as hotel rates will become relatively
cheaper in terms of foreign currencies and hence would increase demand.
Justiﬁcation for the government of Singapore’s continuous attempts to control
inﬂation is given by the results that a 1% rise in inﬂation rate would result in
a signiﬁcant 14.76% fall in the Hotel index. Controlling inﬂation would ensure
that tourism remains a competitive sector of the Singapore economy.
CONCLUSION
This paper examined the relation between macroeconomic variables and the
Sector Stock Indices represented by the SES All-S Equities Finance Index, SES
All-S Equities Property Index and SES All-S Equities Hotel Index, as well
as the Singapore’s composite stock index, using Johansen’s (1990) VECM, a
full information maximum likelihood estimation model.
Our conclusions were that the Singapore stock market and the SES
All-S Equities Property Index formed signiﬁcant relationships with all
macroeconomic variables identiﬁed, while the SES All-S Equities Finance
Index and SES All-S Equities Hotel Index form signiﬁcant relationships only
with selected variables.
Speciﬁcally, for the SES All-S Equities Finance Index, real economic
activity and money supply were not signiﬁcant, and in the case of SES All-S
Equities Hotel Index, money supply, and short- and long-term interest rates
were insigniﬁcant.
The conclusions drawn from the study will be beneﬁcial in two ways: (1)
whether there exists opportunities for proﬁt from the inefﬁciencies of stock
market mechanisms in the transfer of information between stock markets,
and (2) more speciﬁcally, whether “stock picking” could lead to a superior
earning capability.
The presence of a cointegrating relationship between macroeconomic
variables and stock prices brings the conclusions of the efﬁcient market
hypothesis in doubt. Principally, the behavior of stock market may indeed
be predicted, contrary to the EMH conclusions and policy-makers may need
to reevaluate their economic policy if affecting the stock market is not
something they desire.
The fact that speciﬁc sectors represented in the SGX are individually
affected by to different extent by various macroeconomic variables points to the
possibility of superior returns based on selecting stocks from speciﬁc sectors
of the economy as information becomes available on speciﬁc macroeconomic
variables. Additionally, the beneﬁts of diversiﬁcation as suggested by Grubel
(1968) and Lessard (1973) through selecting stocks from different sectors of

Relationship between Macroeconomic Variables and Stock Market Indices

71

Singapore economy become evident.
Policy-makers need to be careful too when trying to inﬂuence the economy
through changes in macroeconomic variables such as the money supply,
interest rates, or the exchange rate. While aiming to correct macroeconomic
ills such as inﬂation or unemployment, they may inadvertently depress the
stock market, and curtail capital formation which itself would lead to further
slowdown of the economy.
Extending the conclusions of this study to other sectors and to other
markets is a matter of empirical study and one which is worth pursuing.
Ahlgren, Sjoo, and Zhang, for example, have examined market segmentation,
information asymmetry and diffusion of the Chinese stock exchanges and
found evidence of cointegration between A and B share prices for most
ﬁrms, but not for all. They then used a probit model to identify the ﬁrm
characteristics that determine whether A and B share prices cointegrate or
not. Their results showed cointegration was more likely among newly-listed
ﬁrms and those in the service and manufacturing sectors.
At the same time, the relationship between macroeconomic variables
and stock markets, though widely documented, is not universally shown or
accepted. For example, to the contrary, Cauchie, et al. (2003) examination
of the determinants of stock returns in the Swiss stock market and showed
that the statistically determined factors yield a better representation of the
determinants of stock returns than the macroeconomic variables and that
stock returns were inﬂuenced by both global and local economic conditions,
suggesting that the Swiss stock market is an internationally imperfectly
integrated market.
Panetta (2003) similarly found the relation between stock returns in
Italy and the macroeconomic factors to be unstable: not only were the factor
loadings of individual securities virtually uncorrelated over time, but a high
percentage of the shares experience a reversal of the sign of the estimated
loadings.
Limitations of the study include the fact that the Error Correction Model
methodology, either as employed by Engle and Granger (1987) or Johansen
(1990) have been known to be sensitive to the choice of lag lengths. The ADF
tests are also sensitive to the speciﬁcation of the variables and the lag lengths
used. For the purpose of comparison, our paper used the same macroeconomic
variables to test for the relationships on the SES All-S Equities Index and
the various SES All-S Sector indices. It may be useful for future studies to
include other economic variables that might affect each sector speciﬁcally.
Two points are worth noting and may provide grounds for further research.
First, since cointegration refers to long-run relationships between the variables
appearing in the cointegrating vector(s), long-term relationship between
macroeconomic variables and sector indices discovered in this paper, does
not by itself prove similar relations exit in the short run. Second, Johansen’s
method is known to be sensitive to the choices of lags and the dimensions.

Mukherjee and Naka (1995) used 20 years of data while employing seven
variables. Due to a more limited number of observations, we used six macro
variables instead. Experimenting with various dimensions and time series
data may, in itself, be a useful study.
The study may be extended by employing Engle and Granger’s (1987)
error correction model so that the short-run dynamics between the variables
could be addressed, much the same way as Maysami and Sim did in the
cases of Hong Kong and Singapore (Maysami and Sims 2002b), Malaysia
and Thailand (Maysami and Sims 2001a), and Japan and Korea (Maysami and
Sims 2001b), or as Islam (2003) did for the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange
(KLSE) Composite Index.
However, given that ours was a preliminary investigation without much
literature precedent, the study concentrated on examining only the long-term
equilibrium relationship among the macroeconomic variables and sector
indices. Moreover, although Engle and Granger’s (1987) two-step errorcorrection model may be used in a multivariate context, the VECM yields
more efﬁcient estimators of cointegrating vectors.
This is because the VECM is a full information maximum likelihood
estimation model, which allows for testing for cointegration in a whole
system of equations in one step and without requiring a speciﬁc variable to
be normalised. This allowed us to avoid carrying over the errors from the
ﬁrst into the second step, as will be the case if Engle-Granger’s methodology
is used.
Finally, in order to address the limitations of Johansen’s (1990)
methodology, e.g. problems with the order of integration, Pesaran and Shin
(1997) proposed the Autoregressive Distributive Lag (ADRL) method. They
showed that the ARDL model remains valid when the underlying variables
are non-stationary, provided the variables are cointegrated. Bentzen and
Engstead (1999) used the ARDL approach to estimated a demand relationship
for Danish residential energy consumption, and compared the ARDL estimates
to the estimates obtained using cointegration techniques and error-correction
models. They concluded that that both quantitavely and qualitatively, the
ARDL approach and the cointegration/ECM approach give very similar results.
Nevertheless, further experimentation with the ARDL may prove a worthy
extension of this study.
